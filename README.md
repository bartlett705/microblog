#TWBG's Microblog
Lance's version of the microblog as seen in the Flask Mega-Tutorial written by Miguel Grinberg.

##Key Features:
-Social Logins via flask-oauth from twitter, google, and facebook.  
-Following/follower structure with new users starting out with a full list of connections (befitting a group that already knows each other).  
-Ability for users to edit or delete their own posts, and change their email/handle/avatar url once logged in.  By default, social login email/handle/avatar will be used, if available.  
-Full text search of posts.
-Markdown support.
